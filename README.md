## Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects completed by me for hobby, self-learning, and academic purposes.

I will be posting periodic updates with projects on topics such as data analysis and visualization, machine learning, natural language processing, and web scraping, among others.

Tools: 
- Data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Machine learning: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow

## Projects: 

### Data analysis and visualization

[Analyzing Police Activity]():
- *In progress, est. completion by 5/25*
- Data cleaning, analysis and visualization proyect to explore Police Traffic Activity in the State of Rhode Island. 
- Were drivers more prone to be arrested on a partilucar weekday? Does sex affect your chances of getting stopped?
- After answering this questions, I analyze the weather for each stop date and investigate if weather affects police behavior..
- Follow the scrpit answer these and many other intersting questions!

[Divvy Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/alantang96/alant-data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Divvy_bike_sharing_AlanT.ipynb):

- ..dive in to find these and more interesting facts on the history of the Nobel Prizes!

### Machine Learning in Python

[Iris Flowers Classifier]():
- This is a simple - yet interesting - machine learning project where I build an Iris Flower Classifier based on different variables
- In this project, I go through the process of importing, managing, and cleaning, and evaluating algortihms, testing and improving models, and presenting results.
- It is a small dataset (150 entries), however, it is a challenging multi-nominal (multi-class) problem. 

[Employee Turnover Predictor]():
- *In progress, est. completion by 5/30*
- This is a personal proyect based on past consulting experience, focusing on a possible reduction in cost by predicting employee turnover rate using different attributes, such as time with company, compensation level and overall satisfaction, to predict if an employee will leave the company or not.
