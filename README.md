## Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects completed by me for hobby, self-learning, and academic purposes, as well as some professional examples.

I will be posting periodic updates with projects on topics such as data analysis and visualization, machine learning, natural language processing, and web scraping, among others.

Tools: 
- Data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Machine learning: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow
- Data Viz: Google Data Studio, Power BI

## Projects: 

### Data analysis and visualization

[Data at work]():
- Identify stakeholder needs, and build ETL pipelines that suite them. Extraction via SQL through Python APIs; Cleaning and Transforming in Python; Loading into spreadsheets, GBQ and dashboards. 
- Ensure data integrity across regions and teams.
- "Gatekeeper" of business metrics and data that powers their calculations. 

[Analyzing Police Activity](https://github.com/alantj96/alant-data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Police%20Activity/Analyzing%20Police%20Activity%20with%20Pandas.ipynb):
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tested data for integrity, mapped variables, merged datasets, and plotted different results.
- Data cleaning, analysis and visualization proyect to explore Police Traffic Activity in the State of Rhode Island. 
- Testing of different questions/hypothesis regarding the correlation between variables.
- Which gender gets stopped the most? Which are the most violations commited? How does weather relate to arrest rates?
- Follow the script answer these and many other intersting questions!

[Divvy Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/alantang96/alant-data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Divvy_bike_sharing_AlanT.ipynb):

- ..dive in to find these and more interesting facts on the history of the Nobel Prizes!

### Machine Learning in Python

[Customer Churn Predictor]():
- Designed, developed and deployed a logit regression model to assign probabilities of customer churn based on historic data. 

[Credit Card Approval Predictor]():
- DataCampÂ´s Data Scientist Track Machine Learning Project
- Predict if a credit card submission will be approved or not using supervised machine learning algorithms
