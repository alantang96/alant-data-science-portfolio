## Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains projects completed by me for hobby, self-learning, and academic purposes.

I will be posting periodic updates with projects on topics such as data analysis and visualization, machine learning, natural language processing, and web scraping, among others.

Tools: 
- Data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Machine learning: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow

## Projects:
